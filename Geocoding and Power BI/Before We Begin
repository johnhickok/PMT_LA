Before we begin, you will need to install some software to your MS Windows PC.
  * ArcGIS Pro - Esri lets you install for home use, if you authenticate via ArcGIS Online
  * MS Power BI - The desktop is free; MS charges for its cloud for sharing.
  * QGIS - Free and open source, visit <a href="https://qgis.org/en/site/">qgis.org</a>
  * PostgreSQL - Free and open source, visit ,a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">postgresql.org</a>
