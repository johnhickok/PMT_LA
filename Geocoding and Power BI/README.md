This will be a brief overview of some of the things I do at work. The short list is below:

1. Load a simple, stylized layer as a vector tile layer into ArcGIS Online via ArcGIS Pro.
2. Geocode the file xxx.csv and create xxx.shp using Python.
3. Upload your shapefile into PostgreSQL using QGIS.
4. Use PostGIS to inspect data and reproject coordinates.
5. Extract a PostgreSQL table into Power BI.
6. Create an Esri Maps visualization in Power BI with your new table and vector tile layer.
